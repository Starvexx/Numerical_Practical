# Numerical_Practical
Numerical methods in python for solving astrophysical problems. These are my solutions to the course Numerical Practical Winter Semester 2020 offered by the Department for Astrophysics at the University of Vienna.

The code in this repository is from my own work and is not the "official solution" to the problems given in the course. There is no guarantee that the code is free of errors.
